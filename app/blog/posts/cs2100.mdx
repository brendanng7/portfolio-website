summary: 'CS2100 is regarded as one of the tougher mods to take in computer science and I understand why'
---

## Workload

Craziest workload so far for me. The number of lectures to watch for this mod is actually too much. The first week we had maybe 6hrs of lectures to watch?
But it gradually became better later in the course.

## Midterm

Not much to comment on. Open-ended question was a bit confusing in the wordings so just be careful.

## Finals

Surprisingly, this year's finals (24/25 semester 1) was a lot more easier than the previous semesters and you can actually finish the paper in time.
It didn't feel like the exam paper was just seeing how fast you can manually trace MIPS instructions in cache or pipelining questions.
The questions on both combinational and sequential circuits was not impossible to solve unlike that one past year question set by a visiting professor. I feel like the toughest section would probably be the MCQ,
that took a lot of effort and time to solve, hence, I decided to prioritise scoring in other areas.

## Conclusion

Pain to take but not impossible to do well.
